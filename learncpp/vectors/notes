* Learn about vectors: Vectors are objects
* Vectors are part of the STL - Standard Template Library
* It can grow and shrink in size at the execution time
* Similar semantics and syntax as arrays
* Very Efficient
* Can provide bounds checking
* Can use lots of super cool funcions such as sort, reverse, find, and more.


Recap on vectors:

Dynamic Size: They will take on the length of the total amount of declared elements

Elements are all of the same type

Stored Contiguously in memory

Individual elements can be accessed by the position of their index

First element is at index 0
Last element is at index -1

[] no checking to see if you are out of bounds
Provides many useful functions to check bounds

Elements are initialized to 0
Very efficient
Iteration looping is often used to process

Can grow when needed.
Will allocate memory for you!
Must be of the same type!
.push_back(element)

Most Vector methods provide bounds checking
An exception and error message is generated
