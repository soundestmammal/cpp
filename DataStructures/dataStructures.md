## Todo

### August 30
- [x] Move the logic out of LinkedList.h and into LinkedList.cpp
- [ ] Change the counter to not be static
- [ ] Do I need to have a current pointer in the class? Or just make one within the member method. It's only a temporary pointer, right?
- [x] Comment my code in LinkedList.cpp
- [ ] Move the logic out of Node.h and into Node.cpp
- [ ] In Assigment 1, alter the seeding of the random number generator.
- [ ] In Assignment 3, filter out the text document using string notation instead of regex.
